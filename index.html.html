			<p class="bodystyle introtext">I'm the kind of person who gets pre-nostalgic. Before something memorable is about to happen I think to myself, "x amount of time from now, I will be reminiscing about this exact moment". I'm not sure why I am like this. But I've always been like this. I remember sitting on the bus, on my way to elementary school, trying with my entire being to remember the exact moment I was in. I took in the houses I was passing, the curse words I heard the big kids say, the writing on the patched up leather seats. No matter how hard I tried, I could never exactly feel like how I felt at that moment.  this morning, did they even happen?</p>

			<p class="bodystyle cartext">There’s something so nostalgic about car rides. My five minute car ride to the train station isn’t especially noteworthy, but it reminds me of high school, when my dad was also dropping me off at school. I would practically jump out of the car and race to my first class since I seemed to always be running late. Sitting and really thinking about my car ride also reminds me how the first times I ever came to the city, I had at least one parent with me. While I always protested my parents tagging along to places I went at home, these times were different. I was hesitant but didn’t put up much of a fight. Going into the city alone seemed like such a huge deal and now I celebrate canceled classes because that means no hour and a half long commute to school. </p>

			<p class="bodystyle traintext">Going to the city always felt so exciting. I loved it every time I went, even if my parents only brought us to touristy places and to the Peruvian embassy. The train was always the first part of it and I remember how I loved to be the one who gave the ticket to the MTA employee. I remember when I first started commuting to the city, I couldn't sleep even if I wanted to. I still felt like the little girl who had to have a window seat, to look out the window. I remember thinking "I don't want to turn into those people who don't care about looking out windows”. I think it only took a month for me to turn into one of those people. While I still always look for a window seat, I stopped looking outside. It’s almost like I need to know that I can look out the window whenever I want to, even if I know I won’t. </p>

			<p>“There’s a privilege of walking slow in a big city like new york.... it means you’re not rushing to get somewhere. You are not concerned about your safety. It’s not freezing cold outside. When all these things align, walking becomes my favorite part of any day.”</p>

			<p class="bodystyle subwaytext">The subway is probably the biggest time warp that I could ever imagine. Time feels like it’s disappearing twice as fast. Rushing to not miss your train. Rushing to get a seat. Rushing to get out of your train and to your next destination. Maybe because it’s the “in-between” of point A and point B, it’s overlooked and fleeting. It comes and goes so quickly, at least for me. I will start my walk towards a station, get on a train, finally get off at my stop and 40 minutes have gone by without even realizing it. Doing this twice a day, almost everyday, it’s scary to think of how much time actually passes when you think it’s only been 15 minutes.</p>

			<p class="bodystyle walktext">Now the biggest tell that I’m not from the city is how I walk. I wouldn’t say I’m a slow walker but I am definitely not fast enough for NYC. Especially if I am not running late, I tend to go from a “stroll” pace, which is just nonexistent in the city. I didn’t even consider walking to school as part of my commute. It wasn’t until this year, my senior year, that I finally realized I could take the express train to 145th street which is within walking distance to my school. Prior to this I was always wasting time waiting for a shuttle at 125th street. The walk is definitely my least favorite part of the commute because of the winds and my 10 pound backpack. The first few days of getting lost because I didn't know which exit to take were miserable but now that I know where I’m going, it has become the more peaceful and slowed down part of my commute. If nothing goes wrong on the subway, I usually have plenty of time to get to class. I look at the buildings around me and wonder what it would be like to actually live in the city.</p>
